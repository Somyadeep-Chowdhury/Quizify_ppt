 * This "Game" class is used to get game names from our message bus(Kafka).
 *
 * The Annotation "@Data" is used as a convenient shortcut annotation that bundles the features
 * of @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter / @Setter and @RequiredArgsConstructor together:
 * In other words, @Data generates all the boilerplate that is normally associated with simple
 * POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).
 *
 * The Annotation "@Id" is used to declare that the field "id" as the Primary Key which will be
 * Non-Null and Unique.
